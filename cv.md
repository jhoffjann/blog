## Projects

### [nmmso.R](https://github.com/jhoffjann/nmmso.R) - Seminar

During a university seminar around R development, I co-developed an implementation of [NMMSO](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6900309/), a multimodal optimization method.

### Ideal Customer Profile - Project Seminar

During the Summer Term 2016, I participated in this project seminar. We took a data-driven approach to identify the Ideal Customer Profile for [Hellmann Worldwide Logistics](http://www.hellmann.net/en/germany/).

### [Object Recognition with Google Glass](https://github.com/jhoffjann/Bachelorarbeit) - Bachelor Thesis

As part of my Bachelor Thesis, I developed an application for Google Glass. This app communicates with a simple Java web server (based on OpenCV) and is able to recognize previously saved objects based on provided photos.
