  content: 'There is a book, published by College Press, 3rd edition in 1963, (Joplin,
    Missouri) by A.B. McReynolds that has a sermon entitled, &#8220;Hell,&#8221; that
    I think lends substance to the fact that hell is real and eternal.  A good rule
    of thumb when studying the scriptures is to interpret the complex in light of
    the simple.  For instance, the language of Matt. 25:46 is simple: &#8220;Then
    they will go away to ETERNAL punishment, but the righteous to ETERNAL life.&#8221;  Same
    word is used to describe both.  Much more will be said about this subject.  I
    look forward to following you scholars to see what you conclude!'

  content: Just cause it's simple doesn't mean it's not super helpful.

  content: I have learned some considerations through your blog post post. One other
    subject I would like to express is that there are lots of games on the market
    designed in particular for toddler age young children. They include pattern recognition,
    colors, creatures, and designs. These usually focus on familiarization as an alternative
    to memorization. This keeps children and kids engaged without having a sensation
    like they are learning. Thanks
