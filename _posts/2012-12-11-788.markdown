  content: Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, won't
    he also give us everything else? Galatians 5:4 You who are trinyg to be justified
    by law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace .Galatians
    3:10  For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written,
    &ldquo;Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book
    of the Law, and do them.&rdquo;(there are 613 Old Covenant Laws)Galatians 3:11  Now
    it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for &ldquo;The righteous
    shall live by faith.&rdquo;
